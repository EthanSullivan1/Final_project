This game is a two-player game with the objective to "kill" the other player. There are two playable characters: a tank and helicopter. The helicopter's objective is to defend the castle by destroying the tank. The tank's objective is to destroy the castle while avoiding fire from the helicopter. The tank has three lives which are visible in the top right corner, while the castles life is visible in the top left. When either the castle or tank runs out of health/lives the game ends. Additional health falls from the top the screen every 10-15 seconds to give the castle more health. This is meant to balance the game since in testing it seemed the tank had an advantage over the helicopter.

To start the game, go to Game.py and run the code under the current file, not main. This will open the start menu which has three options: play game, instruction, and game controls. Play game will run the game and make it playable, instruction will tell you to come look at this file, and game controls shows the keys used in gameplay. This game will not return you to the start menu once the game ends so you will have to run the code from pycharm again and it will reopen the start screen.
